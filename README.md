# Keep Away
![Keep Away logo][logo]
Keep Away is a simple security device that helps protect objects in museums which visitors are not allowed to touch.
## How it works 

![](https://github.com/medihebfaiza/KeepAway/blob/master/docs/tex/imgs/fonct1.png)

* Keep Away warns the visitors by telling them to keep a safe distance.

* If a visitor doesn't respect the safety distance, Keep Away captures a photo of the visitor and sends it to the security guard.

* Finally, the security guard checks if the object was harmed by the visitor.
